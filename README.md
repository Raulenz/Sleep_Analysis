# Sleep_Analysis
This repository explores the relationship between sleep and running performance using data collected from a Garmin Instinct smartwatch.

Data:

Raw activity and sleep data exported from Garmin Connect in CSV format.
Data includes metrics like sleep duration, sleep stages, heart rate variability (HRV), daily steps, running distance, pace, and elevation gain.
Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Initial cleaning and visualization of sleep and running data using Google Sheets.
Univariate and bivariate analysis to identify potential relationships between sleep metrics and running performance.
R Programming:
In-depth analysis and statistical modeling using R:
Sleep quality assessment using HRV and sleep stage data.
Examining correlations between sleep duration, sleep stages, and running performance metrics (pace, distance, etc.).
Building linear regression models to predict running performance based on sleep factors.
Repository structure:
